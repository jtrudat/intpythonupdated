# SD10 Principles of Programming with Python

## Glossary of Terms

We may use different verbiage than you are accustomed to, and some terms may be used interchangeably. Below are definitions describing the structure of the program and the way content is delivered.

- **Program**: Refers to the Software Development Program
- **Course**: This is the largest unit within a program. The Software Development Program is divided into 11 courses, with each covering a broad knowledge area.
- **Introductory Course**: This is the first course of the Software Development Program. Attending and passing the assessment for this course is required for entry into the Extended Program.
- **Extended Program**: Courses 2-11 of the Software Development Program
- **Lesson**: One hour of course content (e.g., lectures, labs, code-alongs, homework, group activities, etc.)
- **Module**: This term is synonymous with a day of class or class session. Modules typically include three to four lessons. Class days may be of varying lengths, so sometimes the fourth lesson will be homework or content that is meant to be read or completed outside of class time.
- **Asynchronous**: This term describes content that is intended to be read or completed outside of class time. It may include homework or optional content.

## Course Details

### Duration

The course includes 36 hours of content delivered over nine modules.

### Course Description & Learning Goals

The Principles of Programming with Python course introduces you to a second programming language. The first half of the course demonstrates how the core principles of programming you've learned thus far through JavaScript can be applied to learn other languages. The end of the course delves into algorithms and data structures, preparing you for technical interviews.

### Learning Objectives

- Define the basics of Python syntax and functionality by relating them to JavaScript.
- Analyze the object-oriented and functional programming paradigms through the lens of Python.
- Develop a full-stack web application with Python.
- Use data structures and algorithms to solve common interview challenges.

## Requirements

### Extended Program Requirements

- Attend at least 80% of classes.
- Submit at least 80% of the assignments.
- Adhere to the code of conduct.
- Earn a passing grade on all milestone projects.

There are no prerequisites to pass individual courses in the Extended Program. However, the assignments and attendance in this course will contribute to your cumulative grade. Also, the concepts learned in this course are fundamental to the rest of the program. It is not recommended to miss any of the material.

**If you miss a class session, please work with your instructional team to catch up on your own time.**

### Software & Technical Requirements

There are no additional hardware requirements for the Extended Program beyond what was required for the Introductory Course.

## Grading

### How Grades Work

For assignments both inside and outside of class, the grading will be a simple pass/fail system. We do not want to become bogged down in a complex grading system for day-to-day activities. The table below shows what to expect:

| Assignment Grading Criteria                | Done? |
|--------------------------------------------|-------|
| Was the assignment submitted via Canvas?   |  Yes  |
| Was the assignment at least 50% complete?* |  Yes  |
| Result:                                    | Pass  |

*Note: An assignment does not necessarily need to be complete for you to receive credit. We encourage you to submit incomplete work on which you have spent at least an hour, even if you got stuck. Remember, we learn when we push the boundaries of our comfort zone!

### Starter & Solution Code

Most activities, including labs, homework assignments, and in-class code-alongs, will come with either a GitHub repository that contains both starter and solution code on different branches or a Replit. The solution code is provided for you to check your work. If you get stuck, it can help you get past the blocker. This is different than many other programs for the following reasons:

- We want you to have a lifeline for help when coding by yourself.
- We want to reduce the temptation to copy and paste. At the end of the day, you are responsible for knowing the concepts when walking into your first job. Copying and pasting answers will not help your future self.
- This program is designed for adults, and we believe you will use the solution code responsibly and in a way that best serves you personally.
- Knowing how to apply a solution to a unique situation or integrate it with existing code is often more important for a coder than simply knowing the solution code. We believe this approach best reflects actual working conditions for software developers.

### Pulse Quizzes

Like the Introductory Course, the Extended Program contains many quizzes for you to complete on your own time. Finishing these self-graded quizzes will unlock the next lesson's content in Canvas. Instructors do not need to ask about or grade these pulse quizzes. They are intended to be study guides and checkpoints for you.

**Note: The assessments in the Extended Program are self-guided, self-paced, and self-corrected quizzes that help you review topics covered in class. You are encouraged to complete the assessments on your own time.**

## Course Overview: Day-by-Day Breakdown

Note: The terms module, class session, and day of class are used interchangeably.
